## Experience

2+ years developing cloud-computing infrastructure for scientific applications, 7+ years developing large scale online/social/mobile games and infrastructure, 3 years as post-doc working in the field of computational biology.

###### 2014-present

Senior Software Engineer at [Bionano Research](http://bionano.autodesk.com/), [Autodesk](https://autodeskresearch.com/groups/bionano).

 - Designed and built [Cloud Compute Cannon](https://github.com/Autodesk/cloud-compute-cannon). CCC puts scalable cloud computing into the hands of scientists. CCC can be easily installed locally, or in the cloud (AWS), and provides a simple API for running any scientific compute jobs.


##### 2012-2014

**Lead Mobile Engineer** at [Idle Gaming](http://idle-gaming.com/) for "Fresh Deck Poker" [[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fresh-deck-poker-live-texas/id536381662?mt=8) [Google](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.idlegames.eldorado&hl=en) [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Idle-Games-Poker-Fresh-Deck/dp/B00D31EAJ0) [Facebook](https://apps.facebook.com/freshdeckpoker/?kt_type=fbPage)].

- I led a small team that published the iOS and Android versions of Fresh Deck Poker in record amount of time without compromising performance, by using the right combination of technology and people.
- I developed for both the front-end client and the back-end systems, ensuring maximum of performance, development velocity, and long-term maintainability+flexibility in the codebase.

Technology stack: Cross-platform front-end (Cocos2d-x, Objective-C, C++, Java, Lua), mostly Python back-end.

##### 2008 -- 2010

**Software Developer** at [Three Rings Design, Philadelphia][ooo]. Prototyped and developed flash social games.

- Prototyped a large number of games, compared to the industry average rate of released games, by building re-usable components at the right level of software abstraction, and building upon appropriate existing software.

Games released:

- [Biteme](http://dionamago.net/?p=214)
- [Vampire Whirled](http://dionamago.net/?p=205)
- [GOBama](http://dionamago.net/?p=82)
- [Politick](http://dionamago.net/?p=69)

Technology stack: Flash front-end (with the Facebook API), Java backend.
     
##### 2005 -- 2008

**[Postdoc](http://www.bornberglab.org/people/whitehead)** at the [Institute of Evolution & Biodiversity][ieb], Münster University, Germany.

- Collaborated with biologists to analyze a large and unique data set, providing unique software tools due to my deep understanding of the data, the statistical methods, and the possibilities of multiple interconnected software packages.
- Planned, supervised, and executed multiple research programs simultaneously.
- Developed a Python course for biologists with little coding experience that allowed them to solve real research and coursework problems.
- Taught Python, bioinformatics and [R](http://www.r-project.org/) courses in German and English, having only learned German at the beginning of my PhD.

Technology: Java, Python, [Condor](http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/) (a distributed computing system), R.

##### 2001-2004 

PhD student, [International NRW Graduate School in Bioinformatics and Genome Research](http://www.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de/index.php/graduate-programs), Bielefeld university, Germany. Built tools for integrating different kinds of databases and tools for visualization of complex data.

Technology: Java, R.
