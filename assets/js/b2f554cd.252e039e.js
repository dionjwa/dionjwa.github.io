Assume it\u2019s a good idea, then think about what it would take to do so. {#2f7830909de04ba4af615d51d0a5d8eb}\\n\\n\\n![](./744654187.jpg)\\n\\n\\nWhat are the logistical challenges in having whales be the spacefaring race. This makes senes because whales have evolved for low-gravity, which is very harmful to humans, and live in dark and cold environments. Please use as much known physics and math as possible, for example, current rate of increase of mass delivered to space, for making a high level estimation for the feasibility of getting a whale into space. Consider that the whale will need a minimum amount of water.\\n\\n\\n# ChatGPT {#19e430d07cf345f6b55716adcec20ecc}\\n\\n\\nThe idea of whales as a spacefaring race presents a host of unique logistical challenges. Let\'s break down the major factors:\\n\\n1. **Adaptation to Low-Gravity Environment**: Whales, evolved for an aquatic environment, might theoretically be better suited to low gravity than land-dwelling creatures like humans. In water, whales experience buoyancy, which reduces the effect of Earth\'s gravity. However, space\'s microgravity environment is quite different from being buoyant in water. In microgravity, there\'s no resistance like water to help whales move or maintain their shape. Their bodies are adapted to be supported by water, and without it, they might face health issues.\\n2. **Life Support System**: Whales require a vast amount of water, which serves as their living medium. A whale in space would need a spacecraft filled with water to simulate its natural habitat. This leads to significant challenges:\\n\\t- **Mass of Water**: Water is heavy (1 cubic meter weighs 1 ton). A blue whale, for instance, could require thousands of cubic meters of water. Let\'s do a rough calculation considering a smaller whale species, like a Minke whale, which might need a minimum of 1000 cubic meters of water:\\n\\t- $Mass\xa0of\xa0Water=1000\xa0cubic\xa0meters\xd71000\xa0kg/cubic\xa0meter=1,000,000\xa0kg$\\n\\t- **Delivery to Space**: Current rockets can deliver about 20-25 tons (20,000-25,000 kg) to Low Earth Orbit (LEO). Assuming the most optimistic capacity of 25,000 kg per launch, we would need:\\n\\t- $Number\xa0of\xa0Launches=25,000\xa0kg/launch1,000,000\xa0kg\u200b=40\xa0launches$\\n\\n\\t\\tThis is for the water alone, not accounting for the spacecraft, life support systems, or the whale itself.\\n\\n3. **Temperature and Pressure Control**: Whales are adapted to specific pressure and temperature ranges. Any spacecraft would need to simulate these conditions, which adds to the complexity and mass of the spacecraft.\\n4. **Feeding and Waste Management**: Whales consume large quantities of food and produce significant waste. Any space mission would need to address how to supply food and manage waste in a zero-gravity environment filled with water.\\n5. **Psychological and Health Concerns**: The impact of space travel on the whale\'s psychology and physiology is unknown. Issues like bone density loss and muscle atrophy, seen in human astronauts, could also affect whales, albeit differently due to their aquatic nature.\\n6. **Cost and Resources**: The cost of launching the required mass to space is enormous. Considering the current cost per kilogram to LEO and the mass of water and life support systems needed, the financial resources would be substantial.\\n7. **Engineering Challenges**: Designing a spacecraft that can hold a whale, water, and life support systems is an unprecedented engineering challenge. It would require innovations in materials, propulsion, and life support systems.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while whales have certain characteristics that might seem advantageous for space travel, the practical challenges are enormous. The mass of water needed, life support requirements, and engineering challenges make this a highly impractical endeavor with current technology and understanding of space travel."},{"id":"/tools-for-the-job","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/tools-for-the-job","source":"@site/blog/blog/tools-for-the-job.md","title":"Data room- Tools / Software matched to job","description":"See disk space usage","date":"2024-11-22T15:36:55.031Z","formattedDate":"November 22, 2024","tags":[],"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Dion Whitehead","title":"Metapages Inventor","url":"https://evolvedeeptimecomplex.systems/","imageURL":"https://github.com/dionjwa.png","key":"dion"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Data room- Tools / Software matched to job","sidebar_position":10,"slug":"/tools-for-the-job","authors":["dion"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Question- can we get whales into space, if they would be better in space than we are?","permalink":"/blog/feasibility-whales-in-space"},"nextItem":{"title":"Blob storage is a solved problem- what about compute?","permalink":"/blog/blob-storage-is-solved-but-what-about-compute"}},"content":"**See disk space usage**\\n\\n\\nGrandPerspective\\n\\n\\n**SVG Icons (free, no watermark, decent library)**\\n\\n\\n[https://iconsvg.xyz/](https://iconsvg.xyz/)\\n\\n\\n[https://www.svgrepo.com/](https://www.svgrepo.com/)\\n\\n\\n[https://www.flaticon.com/](https://www.flaticon.com/)\\n\\n\\n**Image Editing**\\n\\n\\nPixelmator Pro\\n\\n\\n**Screen capture, video of UI, tutorials, docs**\\n\\n\\n[link_preview](https://github.com/flameshot-org/flameshot)\\n\\n\\n**Video Editing e.g. for webinars**\\n\\n\\n[https://www.techsmith.com/camtasia-pricing.html](https://www.techsmith.com/camtasia-pricing.html)\\n\\n\\n**Create animated text/messaging conversation**\\n\\n\\n[https://chat-animator.com/](https://chat-animator.com/)\\n\\n\\n**Add AI ML to my app, integrated agents**\\n\\n\\nThis one is really good\\n\\n\\n[link_preview](https://github.com/langgenius/dify)\\n\\n\\nNot as good as dify but still good\\n\\n\\n[link_preview](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric)\\n\\n\\n**Forms**\\n\\n\\nThese look nice\\n\\n\\n[https://www.fillout.com/](https://www.fillout.com/)\\n\\n\\n**PDF Editing (when Preview etc isn\u2019t enough)**\\n\\n\\n[https://www.pdfescape.com/](https://www.pdfescape.com/)\\n\\n\\n**Secrets and Credentials**\\n\\n\\n[https://infisical.com/](https://infisical.com/)\\n\\n\\n**Headless Chome Drivers for cloud functions**\\n\\n\\n[https://github.com/microsoft/playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright)\\n\\n\\n**Physical Mailboxes**\\n\\n\\nI\xa0used to use\xa0[https://www.usaddressinc.com/](https://www.usaddressinc.com/)\xa0they were great\\n\\n\\nWe use\xa0[https://travelingmailbox.com/](https://travelingmailbox.com/)\xa0it came recommended to us, we\'ve been happy.."},{"id":"/blob-storage-is-solved-but-what-about-compute","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/blob-storage-is-solved-but-what-about-compute","source":"@site/blog/blog/blob-storage-is-solved-but-what-about-compute.md","title":"Blob storage is a solved problem- what about compute?","description":"Cheap and simple data blob storage is widely available and relatively easy to access and use.

Now I don\u2019t (much): when I build an app or website, that needs some blob storage my thoughts are:\\n\\n1. create a bucket or whatever it\u2019s called in one of some cloud provider, doesn\u2019t have to be the biggest name, they\u2019re all very reliable\\n2. put stuff in\\n3. get stuff out\\n\\nI don\u2019t care where much it is. Why? Because it\u2019s a **solved problem**. Remote blob storage is:\\n\\n- very cheap, and getting cheaper\\n- reliable [1]\\n\\nAt scale however, yes, you do have to think about cost, but those calculations are pretty straightforward business calculations. At anything below very large data, you don\u2019t have to think much about it, and this makes it a **solved problem**.\\n\\n\\nIt\u2019s a solved problem in a similar way that nature has solved storing information: replication, with automated mechanisms for damage repair/reconciliation [2].\\n\\n\\n## Compute is not a solved problem {#7998c587d99540c98564ff6646cb9977}\\n\\n\\nBecause you have to think about it. What I want: \\n\\n\\nI give you some application, some workflow, for example, a machine learning agent, some program I have created, some tool, and it requires from time to time, some level of computing power. You are able to automatically, safely, connect that application to the right level of compute resources as needed.\\n\\n- If the program is in the browser, I might be able to use the GPU, while the tab is open and running.\\n- If the program is downloaded and installed program, I have access to your entire computer, but due to that, security and parasitic programs become a problem.\\n- If I make available some cloud computing, it suddenly becomes complex, with lots of decisions, but with lots of scalable compute resources of different useful types.\\n\\nComputing resources are inherently valuable, and often able to be converted to $$ efficiently via automation.\\n\\n\\nObviously `storage !== compute` but if it were as easy, then I could distribute complex scientific simulations, and revive them years later, and they would \u201cjust work\u201d.\\n\\n\\nThe team at [https://metapage.io](https://metapage.io/) aim to solve that problem: compute as a simple commodity.\\n\\n\\nWhen we can treat compute as a commodity, we have more power over the compute providers. When they manage to get their system to be difficult to move from, you lose bargaining power.\\n\\n\\nPersonally, I default to [https://www.digitalocean.com/](https://www.digitalocean.com/). This isn\u2019t a paid plug! They just do a great job of making plenty of options, at the right complexity/resolution, not too many, not too few.\\n\\n\\nFor my full stacks, I\u2019m using AWS but not directly: my choice of platform vendor ([https://nhost.io](https://nhost.io/)) makes that decision for me.\\n\\n\\n# References {#f72739ff70d843c7b655beb4d3c9c218}\\n\\n\\n### [1] **How data is lost in the cloud** {#5ff5b92126b14c0cb53ba25f3a9f00d3}\\n\\n\\n[https://spanning.com/blog/how-data-is-lost-in-the-cloud/](https://spanning.com/blog/how-data-is-lost-in-the-cloud/)\\n\\n\\n### [2] **Mechanisms of ionizing-radiation resistance** {#7d4f1319505a45ddb4c4b1a2e8c47ceb}\\n\\n\\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinococcus_radiodurans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinococcus_radiodurans)\\n\\n\\nEND PAGE\\n\\n\\n```mermaid\\nflowchart LR\\n\\tst[\\"cloud data\\"]\\n\\tc[\\"compute\\"]\\n  urls[\\"workflows as URLs\\"]\\n  sims[\\"sharable simulations\\"]\\n\\tdt[\\"preserved through deep time\\"]\\n  what[\\"What is a metapage\\"]\\n\\n\\tst --\x3e urls\\n\\tc --\x3e urls --\x3e sims --\x3e dt\\n\\twhat --\x3e sims\\n\\turls --\x3e dt\\n  click st \\"/blob-storage-is-solved-but-what-about-compute\\"\\n  click urls \\"/url-configured-websites\\"\\n  click c \\"https://www.notion.so/metapages/Connect-compute-to-my-tasks-it-s-too-complicated-665f6bbcd4724d5ba3a4b66573473b69?pvs=4\\"\\n  click dt \\"https://www.notion.so/metapages/The-Internet-Archive-and-URL-configured-websites-f4b9e02d29234caa932bd553e1eaec75?pvs=4\\"\\n  click sims \\"https://www.notion.so/metapages/Sharable-Simulations-d8dcdfeed5ef423396086ce22875c735?pvs=4\\"\\n  click what \\"https://www.notion.so/metapages/What-is-a-metapage-What-problems-do-they-solve-570973a394b94e149a89b0455f53803e?pvs=4\\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n```"},{"id":"/a-new-kind-of-scientific-publishing","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/a-new-kind-of-scientific-publishing","source":"@site/blog/blog/a-new-kind-of-scientific-publishing.md","title":"A New Kind of Scientific Publishing","description":"Scientific papers are static artifacts.
