### Software Engineer/Architect, Data Scientist, ex-Game Developer
I'm passionate about understanding complex systems using big data and software, large scale data software architecture, molecular simulation, evolution, biological networks, game development, UX, in no particular order. I have a broad and deep range of interests and abilities, and a thirst for learning.
Currently building teams that build complex things.

- GitHub: [https://github.com/dionjwa](https://github.com/dionjwa)
- Metapages: [https://metapage.io/](https://www.metapage.io/)
## Experience
2 years developing machine learning infrastructure, 2+ years developing cloud-computing infrastructure for scientific applications, 7+ years developing large scale online/social/mobile games and infrastructure, 3 years as post-doc working in the field of computational biology and bioinformatics.
### 2017-present
Senior Software Engineer at [Cogitai, Inc](https://www.cogitai.com//).
- co-designed the technology stack for Cogitai's reinforcement learning [APIs](https://continua.cogitai.com/).
- built from the ground-up, balancing current team abilities with optimal new technology
Technology word salad: golang, python, javascript/typescript/react, terraform, AWS
### 2014-2017
Senior Software Engineer at [Autodesk Lifesciences Reserach](https://autodeskresearch.com/groups/lifesciences).
That group closed down end of 2018. So most of the interesting links are now dead.
- Currently working on [molecular simulation applications](https://github.com/Autodesk/molecular-simulation-tools/) and [Genetic Constructor](https://www.autodeskresearch.com/publications/genetic-constructor-online-dna-design-platform).
- Integrated [GSL](https://autodeskresearch.com/blog/genetic-constructor-and-gsl-best-both-worlds) into Genetic Constructor.
- Designed and built [Docker Cloud Compute](https://github.com/dionjwa/docker-cloud-compute). DCC puts scalable cloud computing into the hands of scientists. DCC can be easily installed locally, or in the cloud (AWS), and provides a simple API for running any scientific compute jobs.
- Integrated [Docker Cloud Compute](https://github.com/Autodesk/cloud-compute-cannon) into the [Autodesk molecule viewer](https://autodeskresearch.com/projects/molecule-viewer), and contributed to the backend.
- Developer the idea of 'Metapages': [connected webpages as applications](https://metapages.org/).
Technology stack: Node.js, Javascript, Docker, Redis, AWS Cloudformation, Python, Haxe, React.
### 2012-2014
**Lead Mobile Engineer** at [Idle Gaming](http://idle-gaming.com/) for "Fresh Deck Poker" [[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fresh-deck-poker-live-texas/id536381662?mt=8) [Google](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.idlegames.eldorado&hl=en) [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Idle-Games-Poker-Fresh-Deck/dp/B00D31EAJ0) [Facebook](https://apps.facebook.com/freshdeckpoker/?kt_type=fbPage)].
- Led a small team that published the iOS and Android versions of Fresh Deck Poker in record amount of time without compromising performance, by using the right combination of technology and people.
- Developed for both the front-end client and the back-end systems, ensuring maximum of performance, development velocity, and long-term maintainability+flexibility in the codebase.
Technology stack: Cross-platform front-end (Cocos2d-x, Objective-C, C++, Java, Lua), mostly Python back-end.
### 2008 -- 2010
[**Software Developer**](https://web.archive.org/web/20100408050459/http://www.threerings.net/about/crew.html) at [Three Rings Design, Philadelphia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Rings_Design). Prototyped and developed flash social games.
- Prototyped a large number of games, compared to the industry average rate of released games, by building re-usable components at the right level of software abstraction, and building upon appropriate existing software.
Technology stack: Flash front-end (with the Facebook API), Java backend.
### 2005 -- 2008
[**Postdoc**](http://www.bornberglab.org/people/whitehead) at the [Institute of Evolution & Biodiversity](http://ieb.uni-muenster.de/bioinf), Münster University, Germany.
- Collaborated with biologists to analyze a large and unique data set, providing unique software tools due to my deep understanding of the data, the statistical methods, and the possibilities of multiple interconnected software packages.
- Planned, supervised, and executed multiple research programs simultaneously.
- Developed a Python course for biologists with little coding experience that allowed them to solve real research and coursework problems.
- Taught Python, bioinformatics and [R](http://www.r-project.org/) courses in German and English, having only learned German at the beginning of my PhD.
Technology: Python, Java, [Condor](http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/) (a distributed computing system), R.
### 2001-2004
PhD student, [International NRW Graduate School in Bioinformatics and Genome Research](http://www.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de/index.php/graduate-programs), Bielefeld university, Germany. Built tools for integrating different kinds of databases and tools for visualization of complex data.
Technology: Python, Java, R
